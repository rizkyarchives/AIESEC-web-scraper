# AIESEC-web-scraper
AIESEC Web Scraper is a program that automates the process of obtaining all available internship opportunities that are present inside the https://aiesec.org website. This is made in hopes that it could increase the efficiency of my team's work in AIESEC in UI. At a time, there could be over 300+ available opportunities. Me and my colleagues have a responsibility to curate them and find opportunities that are suitable for Indonesian. Thus, it would cumbersome if we have to manually curate all those opportunities one-by-one.
